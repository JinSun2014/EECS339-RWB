EECS339-RWB
===========

This is a course project for EECS339-Intro to DataBase in Northwestern University, winter 2014.

The goal of RWB is to provide a user with a view of the political activity in his/her vicinty that affects elections for national offies, a view that combines the following sources of information.

In this project, you can:
1. Select which FEC(Federal Election Commission) data you want to see(any combination of committee, candidate, and individual) and for which election cycles.
2. Invite users by sending an one time register email.
3. Add opinions on current location, and see other users' opinions.
4. See a summary form of information of different parties based on the location.

Also, I've done one extra credit that encrypt the user passwaord in database.
